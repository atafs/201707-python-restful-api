# 201707-python-restful-api
A simple RESTfull API that takes and stores comments identified by an SKU. 

## Addicional specs
The API should have a way in which the comment has been analysed to tell us whether the comment is positive or not. To do this, you'll use the Watson Tone Analyser for emotional tone. https://watson-api-explorer.mybluemix.net/apis/tone-analyzer-v3#!/tone/GetTone
